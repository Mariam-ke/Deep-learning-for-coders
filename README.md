# Deep-learning-for-coders<br>

I decided to work on the fastai deeplearning for coders project in order to learn and explore the library and various concepts associated with image recognition. It is designed not only for personal education but also to provide documentation for anyone interested in delving into the fastai framework in the future.

### Technologies/Frameworks Used:
- Fastai library
- PyTorch

### Key Features:
- Focuses on image recognition tasks.
- Implements fastai concepts for practical understanding.
